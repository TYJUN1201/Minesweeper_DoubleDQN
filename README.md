# Using Double Deep Q-Network to learn to play Minesweeper game.
This project is based on the Minesweeper-DDQN implementation from [AlexMGitHub's Minesweeper-DDQN repository](https://github.com/AlexMGitHub/Minesweeper-DDQN).

## Original Minesweeper-DDQN Code
The code for the Minesweeper-DDQN project was originally created by AlexMGitHub and is available under the [MIT License](https://github.com/AlexMGitHub/Minesweeper-DDQN/blob/master/LICENSE). We have used and incorporated their code into our project.

## License
The original Minesweeper-DDQN code is available under the MIT License, which allows us to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and sell the code under certain conditions. Please refer to the [license file](https://github.com/AlexMGitHub/Minesweeper-DDQN/blob/master/LICENSE) for detailed information.

## Modifications
We have made the following modifications to the original code:
- Modifying existing algorithms to implement Deep Q-Network. 
- Changing neural network parameters for training in simpler environments.
